Tokens Module
================================

Tokens are the meaningful parts of a Template. A Token can be required, meaning fully typed by the user, or can have a set of default options preconfigured.

If options are present, then one of them is the default one. Each option follows a {full_name:abbreviation} schema, so that paths can be short but meaning can be recovered easily.
