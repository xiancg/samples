Roadmap
================================

-Implement Template constraints or validations (token length, path length, characters, etc), such that we can not only validate using these constraints but also use these to help when parsing.

-Implement a way so that the user can add validations by passing function objects.

-Create folder structure funtionality

-Implement typing hints

-Implement Filtering for every list section

-Implement autocomplete to the template pattern

-Add a pop-up confirmation when closing the app: "You haven't saved your session. Would you like to save before closing?"

-Implement a way to solve and parse internal naming rules like: {token.pose}_{token.suffix}.{token.extension}

-Allow the users to pass his/her own validations as function objects

-Add support for Tokens passed as empty strings.

-Load multiple repos as a single session or with the possibility to have two repos loaded without conflicting.

-Load tokens and templates recursively from a directory tree, so users can organize their entities more easily. Also implement this in the GUI.
